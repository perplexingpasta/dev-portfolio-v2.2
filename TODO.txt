ALT PROPERTY
The alt property is used to describe the image for screen readers and search engines. It is also the fallback text if images have been disabled or an error occurs while loading the image. It should contain text that could replace the image without changing the meaning of the page. It is not meant to supplement the image and should not repeat information that is already provided in the captions above or below the image. If the image is purely decorative or not intended for the user, the alt property should be an empty string (alt="").
