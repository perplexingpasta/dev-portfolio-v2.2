          We don&apos;t understand it either. In all seriousness, you only have
          to pay ₹5080 once and we&apos;ll work in that for a year. It&apos;s
          not a monthly payment. You only pay once and that&apos;s ₹5080.

          Business emails are very essential for your profession. They&apos;re
          made from your domain so if you get dradamsmith.com as your domain for
          your website, you can have help@dradamsmith.com or
          support@dradamsmith.com as your emails. In our case we have
          hello@celesteconsulting.in. You don&apos;t need to make a new account
          or anything, we&apos;ll simply forward all incoming emails to your
          main email which can be your gmail account. So you get to receive all
          the emails in one single place.

        <div className="text-white-100">
          Only the greatest thing ever! As far as advertising is concerned
          anyways. Here, based on your ad campaign we make landing pages (think
          of them as a single page website on the web). So after someone
          interacts with your ad, they are redirected to this landing page.
          It&apos;s written in such a persuasive manner that the likelihood that
          the person actually gets convinced and buys your services increases
          drastically. It&apos;s based on all sorts of understanding of human
          psychology. They work really well. An ad campaign without the
          persusasive landing pages aren&apos;t just as efficient.

          They both are made to supplement the ad campaigns for their tiers
          respectively. In the starting tiers, an advanced website will suffice
          the traffic that you will receive and will have extraordinary features
          for the same. It&apos;ll be amazing, blazingly fast and will have all
          the bells & whistles. That said, the professional tiers are where the
          fun is at. We design & develop the best website humanly possible,
          I&apos;m talking Apple level website, with all the sleek animations,
          nifty buttons and mind-blowing user experience. It looks so premium
          that whatever high prices you wanna charge for your consultation will
